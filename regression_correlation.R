#Only biomass significant but Susan says to leave in things that are not 
#significant because we can then show that they werenâ€™t significant
#In fact, we can see that there might be some trends with my groups
#can use ANOVA function to see the group level as a whole


lm_cover_cover <- lm(Cover.Phrag ~ Cover.Native + Density + Group, data = final.all)

#group seems to be significant for this one but only this one - bulrush, rush (make sense because they are 0), and grass (idk...)
emmeans(lm_biomass_biomass, pairwise~Group)
#shows the contrasts, adjusted for type 1 error - talk to Maddie about adjusting
#default is the Tukey method

#Might be worth standardizing - she thought it could be good, she will send me a paper 
#easy to do with the scale function in R

#scale centers and scales by default

#cor different from scale because top is scaling across the missing values but cor is using a slightly different
#dataset by removing the NAs - so really we should make a different complete dataset and then scale 
#recommended to report the spearman or the pearson, line 534 is problematic because of the NAs
#if the NAs are removed from 534 then we should get the pearson value, but easier to use the other two 
#tells us that when standardized, we get the correlation as the slope
#spearman is a pearson correlation on the ranked data
